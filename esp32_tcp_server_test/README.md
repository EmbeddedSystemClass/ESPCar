# An example of TCP connection with Python client

Following two directories contain working example of TCP communication between ESP32 and a PC.  

---

Example enables us to press any of the cursor key on the keyboard and turn on the LED connected to pin 18 on ESP32.  
LED is also blinking all the time to prove that the function that is waiting for the commands to come through the TCP stack is non-blocking.
